# Campus-Network
# University Network Design Project

## Overview
Developed a comprehensive computer network design for the Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna's newly constructed two-story building.

## Building Requirements
Catered to various spaces, including computer labs, lecture rooms, library, and offices, considering specific requirements for each area.

## Network Criteria
Implemented VLANs to segregate student and staff access, with a centralized Internet connection patched to the first-floor server room.

## Key Network Components
- Set up an email server for faculty emails
- Web server hosting the faculty website
- File server for remote access to course materials
- Assigned distinct DNS names to each server

## Wireless Network
Established a secure wireless network in the student computer lab, allowing internal access to file and web servers but restricting internet access.

## IP Addressing Scheme
Utilized a 10.0.0 address scheme for all computers and devices, with a 191.1.1/29 network address for Internet routing.

## Physical Design
Implemented a star topology for scalability and efficiency, justified cable media choices, and selected appropriate network equipment.

## Security Measures
Incorporated VLANs, NAT, DHCP IP, and robust security measures on individual routers to ensure a secure network environment.
